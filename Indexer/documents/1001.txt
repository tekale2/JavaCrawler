No single entity or level of government can safeguard wildlife and society against the effects of climate change. When finalized, this draft Strategy will present a unified approach&#x2014;reflecting shared principles and science-based practices&#x2014;for reducing the negative impacts of climate change on fish, wildlife, plants, habitats, and our natural resource heritage. The Strategy will provide a basis for sensible actions that can be taken now, in spite of the uncertainties that exist about precise impacts of climate change. It also will provide guidance about what further actions are most likely to promote natural resource adaptation to climate change, and will describe mechanisms that will foster collaboration among all levels of government, conservation organizations, and private landowners.</P>        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>        <P>Climate change affects more than temperature. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, impacts include shifts in rainfall and storm patterns, increasing wildfires, and more frequent water shortages, as well as rising sea levels, loss of sea ice, ocean acidification, and coastal flooding and erosion. Given the magnitude of the observed changes in climate, it is not surprising that fish, wildlife, and plant resources in the United States and around the world are already being affected. The impacts can be seen everywhere, from working landscapes like tree farms and pastures to wilderness areas far from human habitation. As the climate continues to change over the next century, so too will the effects on species, ecosystems, and their functions. Furthermore, climate-induced changes are also likely to exacerbate existing stresses like habitat loss and fragmentation, putting additional pressure on our nation's valued living resources.</P>        <P>Rapid warming may also begin to threaten the benefits that natural systems provide to people and communities, creating new challenges for human health, infrastructure, agriculture, transportation, and energy supplies. At risk are clean air and water; flood and erosion control; natural resource jobs and income; hunting, fishing, and wildlife-related recreation; and, ultimately, our quality of life.<PRTPAGE P="2997"/>        </P>        <P>Most simply, climate adaptation means helping people and natural systems prepare for and cope with the effects of a changing climate. Climate adaptation is an essential complement to climate change mitigation, or efforts to decrease the rate and extent of climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions or enhancing carbon uptake and storage. Coordinated adaptation planning can help limit the damage climate change causes to our natural resources and communities, and will require new approaches, additional resources, and a coordinated approach across Federal, State, Tribal and local partners.</P>        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Strategy Development</HD>        <P>Over the past decade, there have been an increasing number of calls for action by government and nongovernmental entities to better understand, prepare for, and address the impacts of climate change on natural resources and the communities that depend on those resources. For example, in 2007 the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study entitled &#x201C;Climate Change: Agencies Should Develop Guidance for Addressing the Effects on Federal Land and Water Resources,&#x201D; recommending that guidance and tools be developed to help Federal natural resource managers incorporate and address climate change in their resource management efforts. In 2008, the U.S. Global Change Research Program released the report &#x201C;Preliminary Review of Adaptation Options for Climate-Sensitive Ecosystems and Resources,&#x201D; which called for and identified a variety of new approaches to natural resource management to increase resiliency and adaptation of ecosystems and resources.</P>        <P>In 2009, Congress asked the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the White House Council on Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) to develop a national, government-wide climate adaptation strategy for fish, wildlife, plants, and related ecological processes. Language in the Conference Report for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (House Report 111-316, pages 76-77) urged CEQ and DOI to &#x201C;develop a national, government-wide strategy to address climate impacts on fish, wildlife, plants, and associated ecological processes&#x201D; and &#x201C;provide that there is integration, coordination, and public accountability to ensure efficiency and avoid duplication.&#x201D; In addition, CEQ's Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force supported this request and called for the development of a climate adaptation strategy for fish, wildlife, and plants in its 2010 Progress Report to the President.</P>        <P>In the fall of 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and CEQ invited NOAA and State wildlife agencies (with the New York Division of Fish, Wildlife and Marine Resources as the State agencies' lead representative) to co-lead the development of the strategy. The Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies is also providing support through a cooperative agreement with the Service.</P>        <P>Initial public outreach during 2009 and 2010 contributed toward developing the following set of key principles to help guide this effort as it moves forward:</P>        <P>&#x2022; Build a national framework for cooperative climate response.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Respect jurisdictional authorities.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Provide a blueprint for collective action that promotes collaboration and communication across government and non-government entities.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Adopt a landscape/seascape-based approach that integrates best-available science and adaptive management.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Focus actions and investments on natural resources of the United States and its Territories.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Identify critical scientific and management needs.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Engage the public.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Integrate strategies for natural resources adaptation with those of other sectors such as transportation and agriculture.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Identify opportunities to integrate climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.</P>        <P>&#x2022; Act now: Time is of the essence.</P>        <P>In late 2010, a diverse group of Federal, State, and tribal agencies were asked to participate as members of an intergovernmental Steering Committee, to provide advice and support for development of the Strategy. The Steering Committee includes representatives from 16 Federal agencies with management authorities for fish, wildlife, plants, or habitat, as well as representatives from 5 State fish and wildlife agencies and two intertribal fish and wildlife commissions. The Steering Committee charged a small Management Team, made up of representatives of the FWS, NOAA, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (on behalf of the States), the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to oversee the day-to-day development of the Strategy. The Management Team was asked to engage with a diverse group of stakeholders, as well as to coordinate and communicate across agencies and departments.</P>        <P>In March of 2011, the Management Team invited more than 90 natural resource professionals (both researchers and managers) from Federal, State, and tribal agencies to form five Technical Teams based around major U.S. ecosystems (marine, coastal, inland waters, forest, and combined grasslands/shrublands/deserts/tundra systems). These Teams, which were co-chaired by Federal, State, and tribal representatives, worked approximately 7 months to provide technical information on climate change impacts and to collectively develop strategies and actions for adapting to climate change.</P>        <P>We initially requested public comments and input on the development of the Strategy in a May 24, 2011, notice of intent in the<E T="04">Federal Register</E>(76 FR 30193). After we incorporated initial input, in November 2011 we requested comments on a preliminary draft of the Strategy from selected Federal, State, and Tribal agencies.</P>        <P>We now open the public comment period (see<E T="02">DATES</E>). After considering and incorporating comments from the public, we anticipate releasing a revised, final Strategy by early summer 2012.</P>        <P>Key milestones are shown below:</P>                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">&#x2022; Outreach and Engagement Sessions&#x2014;2009/2010</FP>        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">&#x2022; Steering Committee Formed&#x2014;December 2010</FP>        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">&#x2022; Technical Teams Established&#x2014;February 2011</FP>        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">&#x2022; Agency Review Draft Circulated&#x2014;November 2011</FP>        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">&#x2022; Public Review Draft Announced&#x2014;January 2012</FP>        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">&#x2022; Release Final Strategy&#x2014;May/June 2012</FP>                <P>Ultimately, the Strategy will be a blueprint for common action that outlines needed scientific support, policy, and legal frameworks; recommended management practices; processes for integration and communication; and a framework for implementing these approaches. It will enable national and international conservation communities to harness collective expertise, authority, and skills in order to define and prioritize a shared set of conservation goals and objectives.</P>        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III.
