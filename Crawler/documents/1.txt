Prior to this change, an investor could purchase up to $5,000 each of definitive and book-entry Series EE savings bonds ($10,000 total), and $5,000 each of definitive and book-entry Series I savings bonds ($10,000 total) per person, per calendar year. However, Treasury discontinued the issuance of definitive savings bonds, effective January 1, 2012. (See 76 FR 66,855 (Oct. 28, 2011)). In order to allow investors to maintain the same level of savings that existed prior to the elimination of definitive savings bonds, this rule will permit investors to acquire a principal amount of $10,000 of book-entry Series EE savings bonds and $10,000 of book-entry Series I savings bonds per person, per calendar year. Book-entry savings bonds are offered to individuals through TreasuryDirect &#xAE;, which is an Internet-accessed, book-entry system for purchasing, holding, and conducting transactions in Treasury securities.</P>        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Procedural Requirements</HD>        <P>          <E T="03">Executive Order 12866.</E>This rule is not a significant regulatory action pursuant to Executive Order 12866.</P>        <P>          <E T="03">Administrative Procedure Act (APA).</E>Because this rule relates to United States securities, which are contracts between Treasury and the owner of the security, this rule falls within the contract exception to the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2).
