The Commission's November 28, 2011 ANPR (76 FR 72872) solicited comments on possible disclosures for heating and cooling equipment to help industry members<PRTPAGE P="235"/>and consumers determine whether equipment meets applicable new Department of Energy (&#x201C;DOE&#x201D;) efficiency standards for specific regions. The ANPR's comment period ends on January 10, 2012. Shortly after publication of the ANPR, DOE issued a related Notice of Data Availability<SU>1</SU>          <FTREF/>seeking comments on an enforcement plan for the new regional standards. The FTC disclosures and the DOE plan involve overlapping issues. DOE's comment period ends February 6, 2012.</P>        <FTNT>          <P>            <SU>1</SU>76 FR 76328 (Dec. 7, 2011).</P>        </FTNT>        <P>At a joint December 16, 2011 public meeting about the FTC disclosures and the DOE plan, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy requested that the FTC extend its comment deadline to match DOE's February 6, 2012 date.

The extension will ensure consistent timing in the FTC and DOE comment periods and will provide additional time for comment preparation.</P>        <SIG>          <P>By direction of the Commission.</P>          <NAME>Richard C.
